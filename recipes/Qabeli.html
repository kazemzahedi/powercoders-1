    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, wash and drain the rice in 2 or 3 changes of water.</li>
      <li> Add more water to cover and set the rice aside to soak for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
      <li>  Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium flame and, working in batches, brown the meat on all sides.</li><li> Remove the meat to a plate and set aside.
      </li><li>  Add the onions to the hot oil and sauté until cooked through and softened, 4 to 5 minutes.</li><li> Then add the garlic and whole spices and saute for another minute or so.
      </li><li>Return the meat to the pot and pour in the stock or water along with salt and pepper to taste. </li><li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the meat is fork tender.
      </li><li>Strain the meat, onions and spices from the simmering broth and set aside, reserving the broth.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 1/4 cup of oil in a saute pan or large pot over medium flame.</li><li> Add the carrots and saute for 1 to 2 minutes to soften. </li><li>Stir in the sugar and continue to cook for 1 or 2 more minutes to lightly caramelize the sugar, taking care not to let it burn.
        </li><li>Remove from heat and carefully stir in 1 cup of the reserved broth. (Be careful. </li><li>It may splatter a bit). </li><li>Then stir in the raisins, cardamom and salt to taste and set aside.
        </li><li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. </li><li>Drain the soaked rice and stir it into the boiling water. </li><li>Return to a boil and cook the rice for 3 or 4 minutes.</li><li> Then drain the rice, discarding the water, and place it into a large bowl.
      </li><li>  Lightly oil or grease the inside of an large ovenproof pot with a lid. Mix the remaining broth with the reserved rice.</li><li> Spread half the rice smoothly over the bottom of the greased pot.</li><li> Spread the reserved meat and onions evenly over the rice.</li><li> Top the meat with the carrots and raisins.</li><li> Finally, layer the remaining rice smoothly over the other ingredients in the pot.
        </li><li>Use the handle of a wooden spoon to poke four or five holes through to the bottom of the pot. </li><li>These holes allow excess liquid to boil out of the rice so that it doesn't get soggy.</li><li> Cover the top of the pot with a clean kitchen towel. </li><li>This keeps condensed steam from dripping back onto the rice.</li><li> Finally top the pot with a tight-fitting lid and fold the overhanging towel over the lid.
        </li><li>Set the pot over medium-high flame for 3 to 5 minutes. </li><li>Next reduce heat to low and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes.</li><li> Remove the pot from the heat and let it rest, covered, for another 10 minutes.
        </li><li>Gently stir the rice and meat together with a large fork. </li><li>Mound the pulao on a large serving dish and garnish with the toasted almonds and a sprinkling of garam masala.</li><li> Serve warm.
